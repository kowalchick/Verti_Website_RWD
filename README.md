Link to demo of this site is [here](https://kowalchick.github.io/Verti_RWD)

## Short Description of my work

This website is a task I was doing on bootcamp JavaScrip Developer after the second week of my study.

The page is based only on simple HTML and CSS code. SASS technology was added. This task was also about to learn how to make a responsive web design project using Grid. To compile SCSS files I have learned GULP.
More advanced pages are comming soon (with my progress on the course).

All guidelines I received from my school are based on web site link which is available [here](https://html5up.net/verti). 

I added a small features of mine to this layout. During the whole process of finishing this task I also realized that in the original Verti site there are some bad practices used like: styling elements by their id directly or using the !important exception instead of referencing css classe. 

All works I needed to do on my own starting from scratch. It was a final task of the second week. 


Enjoy!
